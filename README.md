* MPI, open Gl
* Created 15 uavs, that start on a football field. They fly towards a sphere located 50m above the center of the football field. They will circle along the surface area of the sphere for 60 seconds.
* The scene is rendered using openGL in real time. Each uav is controlled by a different process using the MPI framework
